## How does this extension differs from the other Outlook intgeration?

The other extension is made by Veda Consulting and is used for Outlook 2016. The way how Outlook 365 works differs
from how Outlook 2016 works. That is why this extension is made as add inns for Outlook 2016 are not compatible with Outlook 365.

* PHP v7.0+
* CiviCRM (Version 5.13 or newer)
